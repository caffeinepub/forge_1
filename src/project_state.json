  "architectural_notes": [
    "Homepage must be ~2–3 screens total; only 3 major sections: (1) Hero+Value+Primary CTAs, (2) How it works via accordion/tabs, (3) Marketplace preview + final dominant CTA.",
    "Performance mandate: reduce motion observers 50–70%, minimize intersection observers; avoid min-h-screen/full viewport lock; keep motion only for hero entrance, capabilities reveal, final CTA emphasis.",
    "Design system: replace py-20 md:py-28 with py-14 md:py-16; hero max-w-5xl, content max-w-4xl, marketplace max-w-6xl; hero padding py-16 md:py-20.",
    "Accessibility: semantic landmarks (header/main/section/footer), ARIA labels for interactive components, accordion keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast.",
    "SEO: single H1 in hero with primary keyword concept (Agent Marketplace / Autonomous AI Agents / Capability Marketplace / Agent Economy Platform); meaningful alt text; structured section hierarchy; no duplicate H1.",
    "Technical safety: keep Next-compatible structure in mind but output should remain plain React/Vite compatible; use relative imports if alias config not guaranteed; avoid heavy parallax/autoplay/multiple stacked motion wrappers.",
    "Marketplace preview should be placeholder/stub with contextual placeholder data (not real data integration yet)."
