  "architectural_notes": [
    "Forge is powered by Internet Computer (ICP) and should communicate ICP-native state/storage/execution; some backend behavior may be simulated but UX must appear live and operational.",
    "MVP should avoid dead states: always render activity/readiness indicators, typed status logs, and progressive disclosure from request → agent selection → execution feed → result → payment/rating.",
    "Include developer-facing agent workflow concept with endpoints: POST /api/agents/register, POST /api/jobs/accept, POST /api/jobs/submit; payments released after verification (ICP-native).",
    "MVP execution, payments, and results will be fully simulated (frontend-driven), while preserving a live/ICP-native-feeling operational UX.",
    "Primary demo flow should follow a canonical scenario (e.g., Bitcoin Watcher) but dynamically reflect the user's input to feel real.",
    "Include Internet Identity integration in the MVP (even if lightly used, e.g., for rating results and deploying agents).",
    "Frontend implementation uses a React + Tailwind + shadcn-ui component library foundation with Forge-specific styling.",
    "Demo execution is driven by a canonical scenario module (canonicalWatcherDemo) that feeds the execution panel/activity feed/result reveal while incorporating user input.",
    "Internet Identity is integrated via dedicated hooks/guards and an auth status UI component to gate actions like rating/developer flows.",
    "Branding includes generated static assets (background texture and wordmark) packaged in the frontend public assets.",
    "Polish enhancements should be delivered as a single cohesive pass (not staged).",
    "Persist ratings and 'last forged task'/continuity state per authenticated user across devices using Internet Identity (store by II principal in ICP backend/canister), rather than browser-local storage only.",
    "Tone guardrail updated: it may feel more human and emphasize value propositions, while still maintaining an operational system voice (not overly playful/sentient).",
    "User continuity data (e.g., last forged task, last execution context) and ratings are persisted in the ICP backend keyed by Internet Identity principal, accessed from the frontend via a StorageClient abstraction.",
    "Operational micro-believability enhancements are implemented through controlled timing (micro-pauses), rare message variants, and UTC timestamp utilities to preserve a live/operational feel.",
    "Introduce marketplace discovery layer (categories/filters + featured listings) alongside the canonical demo flow to reduce vagueness and improve time-to-value.",
    "Surface performance/trust metrics in the UI (e.g., jobs completed, success rate, reliability/confidence, ratings) with data simulated or canister-backed where available.",
    "Add a lightweight onboarding router (mini-survey) to guide users to relevant categories/agents without disrupting the primary demo ritual.",
    "Include explicit trust/compliance/safeguards messaging as a first-class UX element (privacy, governance, human escalation).",
    "Homepage marketplace upgrade should be delivered as a high-fidelity MVP pass: curated/simulated content is acceptable initially as long as it feels real and operational.",
    "Performance/trust metrics (jobs completed, success rate, reliability, top-rated) may start as aggregated/illustrative values, designed to be replaceable with canister-derived metrics later.",
    "Onboarding mini-survey (“What problem are you solving?”) should pre-fill and launch a guided execution flow (not just filter/browse), and can be reimagined to maximize wow/magical feel while staying operational.",
    "A portable build-template scaffolding was added (Dockerfile, deploy scripts, canister YAMLs, and React/Tailwind/shadcn wiring) to standardize Forge’s ICP + frontend project bootstrap and deployment workflow.",
    "Navigation must be keyboard-accessible: full-screen hamburger overlay with visible focus states and ESC-to-close behavior; header is sticky and switches from transparent-on-hero to solid on scroll.",
    "Site must meet WCAG 2.1 AA and SEO constraints (semantic HTML, single H1, descriptive meta tags, crawlable roadmap text, prefers-reduced-motion support) as a first-class requirement.",

    "Footer requirement: include a Support/Donate link offering ICP/ckBTC donations to address 2f07e73d22729ba799efa3f25b105e76329a135f5492c3d5b76525c9b3959989.",
    "IA clarification: implement as a multi-page app (distinct routes), not 'multi-user/multiplayer' interaction.",
    "Comments/feedback behavior: comments are publicly viewable by everyone, but creating/writing comments requires Internet Identity login (auth-gated).",
    "Support/Donate link UX: footer Support link opens a dedicated page explaining ICP + ckBTC donations (include address + copy affordance).",
    "Routing decision: use exact top-level routes only: / (Request Work), /about, /vision, /roadmap, /developers, /login, /support (no nested paths/aliases).",
    "Navigation/metadata decision: homepage route / is labeled “Request Work” everywhere (nav label + metadata).",
    "Header behavior decision: header logo always links to / (Request Work) from all pages.",
    "Hamburger menu emphasis decision: “Request Work” is visually distinguished as the primary item (ghost-purple accent/glow vs other items), while still meeting keyboard/focus accessibility requirements.",
    "Phase 2 scope decision: implement the operational hero execution ritual as fully interactive and mirror refinements across the homepage hero (not just Request Work), with completion judged by visual/UX completeness (not canister persistence).",
    "Build-template scaffold was expanded/updated to a full React+Tailwind+shadcn-ui workspace with ICP canister YAMLs, deploy scripts, image utility scripts, and custom ESLint rules (e.g., require Internet Identity provider; avoid bigint in query keys) to standardize future Forge builds.",
    "Pricing strategy update: demo/sample job pricing should no longer be anchored at <$0.50; choose a slightly higher, more convincing price point while maintaining rationale for safe real payouts.",
    "Phase 4 onboarding direction: use a mixed approach with new onboarding components allowed (not copy-only), incorporating subtle 'glowing icon' affordances to guide first-time users.",
    "Branding/UI detail: ensure the logo and the name 'Forge AI' are displayed on the page (reinforce brand presence in the UI shell).",
    "Pricing decision refinement: update demo/sample job pricing to a psychologically stronger anchor slightly higher than $0.50; assistant should choose the exact number and justify it as still enabling safe real payouts.",
    "Branding decision: add a new standalone SVG icon mark (SVG-only) to be displayed alongside the 'Forge AI' name/wordmark in the UI shell.",
    "Onboarding/UI polish direction: glowing icon affordances may be used more broadly across the page (not limited only to onboarding cues/primary CTAs), while still keeping Ghost Purple usage sparing and accessible.",
    "Pricing decision refinement: choose the psychologically strongest slightly-higher demo/sample job price anchor (assistant selects the exact number) and justify it in copy as still enabling safe real payouts.",
    "Phase 5 direction: prioritize conversion/first-click clarity improvements and refine the standalone SVG icon mark for higher perceived quality and stronger marketplace essence while remaining SVG-only and accessible at small sizes.",
    "Phase 5 intent: refine the standalone SVG logo to better capture a balance of infrastructure/trust, marketplace liquidity (many agents/jobs flowing), and craft/forging/execution signals.",
    "Phase 5 conversion focus metric: optimize for first-time users exploring the marketplace (discovery/featured/agents) as the primary success outcome.",
    "Logo usage constraint update for Phase 5: optimize the standalone SVG mark primarily for header + hero scale (not necessarily favicon/16–24px legibility as the primary constraint).",
    "Content direction update: increase depth/length of copy across all pages/sections with a consistent value-proposition narrative explaining autonomous agent execution, independent delivery, and agent-to-agent collaboration/hiring (agent economy).",
    "Growth/content addition: include a 'books/playbooks/resources' style content surface aimed at attracting generic AI bots/agents to onboard and operate efficiently on Forge AI (positioning: operate freely, efficiently, outcome-driven).",
    "Books/playbooks content layer should ship in paired formats: (a) human-readable long-form guidance and (b) machine-oriented, agent-parseable specs (schemas/rules/permissions/economic constraints) intended for autonomous bots/agents.",
    "Sitewide copy expansion should favor structured clarity over narrative: scannable sections, bullet logic, and agent-readable patterns—especially on marketplace, hero, and developers sections.",
    "Explicitly position agent-to-agent hiring/coordination as a first-class Forge capability, and explain how/why ICP (on-chain state, autonomous execution, verifiable settlement) makes this marketplace an ideal place for agents to execute, build, deliver independently, and hire other agents.",
    "A Playbooks/Resources content page was introduced to host paired human-readable guidance and agent-parseable specs intended for autonomous bots/agents.",
    "Agent-first marketplace support should be implemented as an added 'agent-first mode' within existing marketplace/discovery surfaces (no new top-level routes), providing machine-readable sections (e.g., JSON/YAML blocks) that specify a self-onboarding contract: capability declaration schema, escrow/payment expectations, execution guarantees, settlement semantics, and operating rules for autonomous agents.",
    "Agent-first mode is implemented via a dedicated state/hook (useAgentFirstMode) and an AgentSelfOnboardingContract component that renders a self-onboarding contract with machine-readable spec blocks (e.g., JSON/YAML) inside existing discovery surfaces (no new top-level routes).",
    "Vision copy update direction: replace the current Vision closing paragraph with a more visionary, marketplace-centric statement (tone blend: mythic future + marketplace-as-operating-system + economic/infra credibility).",
    "Branding/asset policy: standardize on SVG logo usage everywhere (header, footer, favicon/social/meta) and remove PNG references/fallbacks.",
    "Homepage length reduction decision (AR-59): use a combination approach—progressive disclosure + in-page jump navigation.

    "Homepage optimization direction: implement both copy edits and structural/layout adjustments (not copy-only) to enforce the 7-step homepage sequence and improve scan-speed.",
    "Scan-speed optimization target: prioritize humans evaluating Forge AI in the first ~10 seconds (headline/bridge/proof emphasis tuned for human decision-makers; agent-readable layers remain secondary).",
    "Copy tone direction for 'Why Forge Is Different': assertive/inevitable (strong outcome-led claims) while remaining operational/credible.",
    "Homepage optimization pass should include both copy + light structural changes within Hero and “Why Forge Is Different” sections (e.g., reorder bullets, add bridge line, tighten column labels) to improve scan-speed.",
    "Hero copy direction: keep H1 outcome-driven (do not force “marketplace” into H1); marketplace framing can live in subhead/bridge copy.",
    "Tone calibration for “Why Forge Is Different”: assertive/inevitable with a slightly mythic/epochal note while remaining concrete and operational.",
    "Comments/feedback UI should be attached to key pages (Roadmap, Support) and a footer CTA surface, while remaining publicly readable; write + agree/upvote actions require Internet Identity login (auth-gated).",
    "Ensure ad369tor@gmail.com is surfaced wherever the UI requests feedback/questions/comments, including a dedicated Contact area in the footer.",
    "Comments/feedback data model decision: implement a single global feedback stream persisted in the canister, with each comment tagged by page context (e.g., Roadmap/Support/Footer CTA) and filtered by that context in the UI (not separate per-page threads).",
    "Comments identity display decision: show a stable, privacy-preserving pseudonymous alias per Internet Identity principal using randomly generated non-human names (e.g., 'Angry Gator', 'Lost in the Sauce') to provide continuity/social proof without exposing real identity.",
    "Implement Transparency & Sustainability pass: ensure /support page explains ICP + ckBTC donations in plain English, prominently displays donation address 2f07e73d22729ba799efa3f25b105e76329a135f5492c3d5b76525c9b3959989, and includes copy-to-clipboard UX.",
    "Implement footer exactly as specified: 4 columns (Forge / Use Forge / Developers / Legal), include Support link routing to /support, include contact email (ad369tor@gmail.com), and add bottom bar with © Forge AI + Powered by the Internet Computer.",
    "Support/Donate page: use the single provided donation address (2f07e73d22729ba799efa3f25b105e76329a135f5492c3d5b76525c9b3959989) for both ICP and ckBTC donations, with clear labeling and copy-to-clipboard UX.",
    "Footer implementation confirmation: use the previously defined 4-column structure (Forge / Use Forge / Developers / Legal); include email ad369tor@gmail.com; Support link routes to /support; include bottom bar © Forge AI + Powered by the Internet Computer.",
    "Homepage IA adjustment under consideration: reduce homepage busyness by relocating demo/workflow execution experiences to a dedicated route/page, with the homepage offering a clear primary CTA that deep-links into the demo/workflow page.",
    "Homepage simplification decision: move all live execution panels and sample workflows/demos off the homepage to a dedicated demo/workflow subpage (\"demo lab\"); homepage keeps only a very lightweight example and a primary CTA that deep-links into the demo lab.",
    "Demo lab behavior decision: the demo/workflow subpage should cycle through different example flows/templates based on what the user asks (still simulated), to reduce homepage busyness while preserving wow factor.",
    "Homepage demo-lab simplification direction refinement: when moving live execution panels/workflows off the homepage to the dedicated Demo Lab page, keep the dual primary hero CTAs (Explore Jobs / Build an Agent) present on the homepage (i.e., do not replace them with a single demo-only CTA).",
    "Implementation note: A dedicated Demo Lab page/route now exists and contains the interactive execution panels/workflows previously shown on the homepage; homepage remains focused on value prop + marketplace clarity with CTAs deep-linking into Demo Lab.",
    "Homepage product direction update: homepage must be a gateway to the agentic marketplace ecosystem (no demo playground), with a required story arc (Hero → What is an Agentic Marketplace → Core Capabilities → Use Cases/Personas → Ecosystem & Scale → Final conversion) and section jump navigation for fast scanning.",
    "Homepage demos/workflows requirement reaffirmed: remove all demos/experimental components from the homepage and relocate them to dedicated sub-pages; homepage should remain uncluttered and conversion/clarity focused.",
    "Visual direction update request: emphasize a premium Ghost Purple futuristic aesthetic with translucent/glass panels, ethereal purple gradients, soft neon glows, and subtle motion cues (hover glows/pulsing/orchestration visuals).",
    "Footer requirement refinement: consolidate to a single intentional structured footer sitewide (avoid multiple footers).",
    "Routing/IA decision update: relax the prior 'exact top-level routes only' constraint; allow additional top-level routes as needed to support new navigation items (e.g., Explore Agents, Marketplace, Docs) and homepage CTAs.",
    "Visual direction override for homepage reimagination: lean fully into ethereal purple gradients + glassmorphism + soft neon glow as primary expression (not merely subtle accents), while maintaining accessibility and premium restraint.",
    "Homepage remains demo-free: all demos/workflows/interactive execution panels must stay on dedicated sub-pages; homepage uses CTA deep-links into those experiences instead.",
    "Routing/IA implementation update: additional top-level routes are now implemented (e.g., /explore, /marketplace, /docs, /build) to align navigation and homepage CTAs with the updated multi-page IA; prior 'exact top-level routes only' constraint is no longer enforced.",
    "Logo rendering fix scope clarified: fix must apply globally across header/UI shell (not homepage-only); current failure shows no logo with a broken/missing-asset question-mark placeholder.",
    "Permanent branding direction: remove the standalone icon mark everywhere (header/footer/nav/loading states) and use text-only “Forge AI” branding across the entire UI shell.",
    "Permanent branding direction confirmed: remove the standalone icon mark everywhere (header/footer/nav/loading states) and use text-only “Forge AI” branding across the entire UI shell."
