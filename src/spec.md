# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Vision page and the Homepage hero block copy for improved clarity, consistency, and outcome-first messaging—without changing layout or other Homepage sections.

**Planned changes:**
- Rewrite all user-facing copy on `/vision` in `frontend/src/pages/VisionPage.tsx` to match the provided Vision draft content, improving readability with a clear heading hierarchy (H1/H2/H3) and reducing unnecessary crypto/blockchain jargon while keeping the same core sections and examples.
- Rewrite only the Homepage hero block text (headline, supporting paragraph, and italic “Later…” line) in `frontend/src/pages/ForgeHomePage.tsx`, preserving the existing Homepage structure and leaving all other sections unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a clearer, more scannable Vision page with consistent headings and plainer language, and the Homepage hero messaging is refreshed while the rest of the Homepage remains unchanged.
