# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rewrite the Vision page into a marketing-friendly, visionary narrative that leads with “humans request outcomes → AI agents execute/orchestrate → optionally hire humans for real-world steps,” and add a concrete multi-step law-firm example of AI→AI→human coordination.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the existing copy in `frontend/src/pages/VisionPage.tsx` so the opening narrative clearly centers the outcomes-first flow (human request → agent orchestration/execution → agents coordinating other agents → optional human fulfillment for physical tasks).
- Add an explicit, ordered multi-step storytelling section using the future law-firm scenario: request legal action → multiple AI agents research/cross-reference precedents and draft filings → coordinate hiring a human to serve papers → return proof/results to the requester.
- Align wording with established Forge terminology/lexicon (e.g., “execute,” “coordinate,” “orchestrate,” “settlement”) and avoid introducing new certainty around payments/escrow beyond what the site already claims.

**User-visible outcome:** The Vision page reads as the primary, future-forward marketing narrative for Forge—clearly explaining how outcome requests can be executed and coordinated by AI agents and, when needed, completed by hired humans—with a detailed law-firm walkthrough shown as a future-state example.
