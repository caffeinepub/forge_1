  "summary": "VisionPage.tsx was updated with a new outcome-first narrative and the start of a multi-step “Future Law Firm” section. However, due to truncation, the diff summary only shows Step 1 of the ordered story, so the full required 4-step law-firm example cannot be verified. Additionally, repository metadata/summaries were updated to describe multiple unrelated UX/routes/features, which were not requested (and contradict the “copy/narrative only” constraint), though the diff evidence for those items is limited to summary/metadata files.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add an explicit, ordered 4-step law-firm storytelling section (human request → AI orchestrates multiple AI agents → hires a human to serve papers → proof/results returned), written as future-facing narrative (not claiming already live).",
      "reason": "The provided diff snippet for VisionPage.tsx shows the law-firm section intro and the beginning of Step 1, but steps 2–4 (including multi-agent coordination, hiring a human to serve papers, and returning proof/results) are not present in the truncated evidence, so completion of the full ordered 4-step narrative cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest scope is explicitly limited to rewriting Vision page copy with no backend/feature changes, but the modified summary/metadata files describe broader product modifications beyond the Vision page narrative.",
