  "summary": "REQ-2 (Homepage hero copy) appears to be implemented in ForgeHomePage.tsx. VisionPage.tsx shows substantial copy/structure updates with H1/H2/H3 present, but the diff is truncated, so it’s not possible to confirm that all required core sections/examples from REQ-1 are included. The diff summary indicates many additional, non-copy and non-requested frontend changes (routing, CSS/motion, multiple components), which violate the copy-only/no-other-changes constraints.",

      "reason": "VisionPage.tsx is truncated in the diff; only the opening vision section and the start of the “Legal Action Orchestration” example are visible.
