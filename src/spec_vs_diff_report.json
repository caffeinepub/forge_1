  "summary": "Diff implements a text-only ForgeBrandMark component and updates major callers (GlobalHeader, HeroSection, ForgeHomePage) to use it; favicon reference appears removed from frontend/index.html. However, the diff does not provide evidence that all other user-visible branding surfaces (e.g., footer brand lockups, loading/empty states) have been audited/updated to prevent any remaining icon-mark rendering. Additionally, project/state and summary files describe broader non-branding changes (routing/pages/UX updates) that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Remove the Forge icon mark from all user-visible UI surfaces and enforce a permanent text-only brand presentation that displays exactly “Forge AI” everywhere branding appears (header, homepage hero branding, any other brand lockups, and any loading/empty states that currently show a logo).",
      "reason": "The diff shows text-only branding updates in header and homepage hero areas, but provides no evidence that other potential brand lockups (e.g., footer, loading/empty states, other pages) were checked/updated to remove the icon mark across the entire app and prevent regressions on route navigation.",

      "description": "Broader homepage/content redesign beyond removing the icon mark (conversion-focused narrative arc, additional sections, CTA/IA changes).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is branding-only; the modified project state/summary content describes substantial homepage restructuring and copy/IA changes beyond what is necessary to remove icon branding.",

      "description": "New or expanded routing/pages (e.g., adding a /demo-lab route and other top-level pages like Explore/Marketplace/Docs/Build).",
      "reason": "Routing changes are explicitly called out as a non-goal unless necessary for icon removal; the diff summary text describes routing additions unrelated to branding removal.",
